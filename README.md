# BIZ_Card-Data-Extraction-using-EasyOCR
This project makes use of the 'easyocr' module to extract information from a business card. The retrieved data is automatically imported into a SQL database. These actions are carried out within a user-friendly GUI built with the 'Streamlit' framework, which improves the overall user experience and makes the entire process intuitive and accessible.
