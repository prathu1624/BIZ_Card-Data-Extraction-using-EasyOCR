# BIZ_Card-Data-Extraction-using-EasyOCR
Hi guys, this is my third project in the Data Science course by GUVI. 
In this project we will be using the "easyocr" module to extract data from a business card.
The extracted data is then uploaded to "SQL".
All these steps are performed in GUI designed by using "Streamlit".
